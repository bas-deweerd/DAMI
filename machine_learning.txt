Machine learning
Discrete vs continuous labels

Supervised learning : Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data
- Classification: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories
- Regression: Models that predict continuous labels

Unsupervised learning : Models that identify structure in unlabeled data
- Clustering: Data assigned to numer of discrete groups
- Dimensionality reduction: Inferring sturcture of unlabeled data

SOM
- Reduces dimensionality using self-organizing clustering neural network
- Humans can't visualize high dimensional data

U-matrix = unified distance matrix

Somoclu = SOM on a cluster

SOM
Input layer
Weights
Kohonen layer = neural processing units, weights per each input

Steps
1) Initialize neural network weights
2) Randomly select an input
3) Calculate winner using euclidean distance
4) Update weights based on winner
